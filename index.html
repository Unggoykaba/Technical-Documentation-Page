      <header>General Email Best Practices</header>
      <p>Email etiquette is the code of conduct that guides behavior when writing or responding to emails. Depending on the recipient of your email, you may modify the principles that determine the proper etiquette. For example, email etiquette changes when you write to a friend, colleague or business acquaintance.</p>
      <p>Your communication reflects your character, work ethic and attention to detail. Companies may benefit from implementing best practices for email etiquette for these reasons:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Professionalism:</strong> Using proper email etiquette conveys a professional image of the organization.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Emails that follow etiquette are direct and concise, conveying their message quickly.</p>
      </li>
      </ul>

      <h1>5 email etiquette guidelines for the workplace</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Use standard formatting</p>
          <p>Standard fonts, such as Times New Roman or Arial, colors and sizes are appropriate for business emails. If you use bold or italics, try not to use them on more than one word or a string of words in a single email.</p>
          <p>If you're copying and pasting text, clear the formatting before sending the email because it could appear different from the rest of your text. To clear formatting, you can use "Command + \" on a Mac or "Ctrl + Shift + N" on a PC.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Include a clear subject line</p>
          <p>Title your email so the recipient knows what the message is about. For example, if you're emailing to follow up on a presentation, you might write, "Quick question about your presentation." Emails with clear and brief subject lines often have better open rates, so it's useful to be descriptive without sharing too much information. Also, consider how much text the email provider can display in an inbox so that your message appears complete.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Email from a professional email address</p>
          <p>Use a company email address if possible. Though, if you're self-employed or using a personal email address for work-related correspondence, ensure that your email address doesn't contain any words that some might consider unprofessional. If so, then consider setting up a work-only email address.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Use the correct email format</p>
          <p>A business email has a specific but simple structure, which includes a subject line, greeting, body and a sign-off. The body of your email may be in short paragraphs. Organize the information in the body section so your recipient can easily understand your message.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Use professional greetings</p>
          <p>Choose a salutation that's appropriate for the relationship you have with the recipient. If you're emailing a coworker, a casual greeting such as "Hello" may be appropriate. If you're contacting someone for the first time or if they're a professional acquaintance, use a more formal greeting like "Dear Sarah Atkins." It's recommended to use the person's name exactly as it's shown in their email signature line. This means don't assume someone named Jennifer goes by Jen unless you've seen them sign their emails that way.</p>

      <header>Troubleshooting Common Issues</header>
      <p>Email is one of the most essential and widely used communication tools in the modern world. However, sometimes you may encounter problems with sending or receiving emails, such as error messages, slow performance, missing messages, or spam. In this article, we will guide you through the steps to troubleshoot email issues and help you restore your email functionality.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Check your internet connection</p>
          <p>The first step to troubleshoot email issues is to make sure that your internet connection is working properly. You can do this by opening a web browser and trying to access a website. If you can't load the website, then your internet connection may be down or unstable. You can try to restart your modem, router, or device, or contact your internet service provider for assistance. If you can load the website, then your internet connection is not the problem and you can move on to the next step.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Verify your email settings</p>
          <p>The next step to troubleshoot email issues is to verify that your email settings are correct and compatible with your email service provider. This can be done by making sure your email address and password are entered correctly, matching the ones used to log in. Additionally, you must check the server names, ports, and encryption methods used to send and receive emails. These settings can be found on the provider's website or documentation, or by contacting them directly. Lastly, you should check your firewall and antivirus settings, as they may block or interfere with your email connection. You can try disabling or adjusting these settings temporarily, but make sure to re-enable them afterwards for security purposes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Test your email client or app</p>
          <p>The third step to troubleshoot email issues is to test your email client or app, and see if it is functioning properly. You can do this by sending a test email to yourself to check if you can send and receive emails. If not, you can try updating your email client or app to the latest version, as sometimes bugs or glitches affect performance. If that doesn't work, you can switch to another email client or app such as Outlook, Gmail, Thunderbird, Mail, or others. You will need to enter your email settings and credentials in the new email client or app and follow its instructions for set up.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Clear your cache and cookies</p>
          <p>The fourth step to troubleshoot email issues is to clear your cache and cookies from your web browser or email client or app. Cache and cookies are temporary files that store information about your browsing or email activity, such as your preferences, history, or login details. However, sometimes cache and cookies may become corrupted or outdated, and cause problems with your email connection or performance. You can try to clear your cache and cookies, and see if that improves your email situation. You can find the option to clear your cache and cookies in your web browser or email client or app's settings or preferences menu, or by following its help or support guides.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Scan your device for malware</p>
          <p>The fifth step to troubleshoot email issues is to scan your device for malware, such as viruses, spyware, or ransomware. Malware is malicious software that can infect your device and compromise your security, privacy, or functionality. Malware can also interfere with your email connection or performance, or even steal or delete your email data. You can try to scan your device for malware, and see if that detects and removes any threats. You can use a reputable and reliable antivirus or anti-malware software to scan your device, and follow its instructions to perform the scan and quarantine or delete any malware.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Contact your email service provider or support team</p>
          <p>The sixth and final step to troubleshoot email issues is to contact your email service provider or support team, and seek their help or advice. If none of the previous steps have resolved your email issues, then there may be a problem with your email service provider's server, network, or system. You can contact your email service provider or support team, and explain your email issues and the steps you have taken to troubleshoot them. They may be able to diagnose and fix your email issues, or provide you with further guidance or solutions.</p>
        </li>
